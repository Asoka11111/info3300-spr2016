	<h3>Prompt for Monday, Feb 1. SVG and interaction</h3>

<!-- Here's a standard HTML div element with an ID and a class -->
<div id="d1" class="header">Hello!</div>

<!-- Here's an SVG canvas element. Note that in this file it looks like the <div> above. -->
<svg height="200" width="200">
  <!-- Visual elements are represented by tags, which have attributes -->
</svg>

<!-- Here are two types of form inputs. -->
<input id="t1" type="text" value="Hello!"/>

		We will be using Javascript to manipulate element of the page.

		1. Text elements, like the "Hello!" above.

	<h3>Discussion</h3>
	<div>Try this <a href="http://scs.ryerson.ca/~aharley/vis/conv/flat.html">interactive demonstration of a deep neural network</a>. The input image appears on the bottom, and the predicted digit classification at the top. Each "layer" of the network represents a "view" of some part of the level beneath it. How is the author mapping the parts of the model to visual elements? How are the interactions between layers represented? What did you learn about deep neural networks, and what is confusing? Is this page successful?
